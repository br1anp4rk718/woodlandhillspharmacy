										Aesthetics is devoted to Non-responsesurgically treating the skin and becoming proactive in skin care.
									</h5>
									<h5 style="margin-left:2em;margin-right:2em;">
										The skin is our largest organ and functions as a protective covering, a sensing organ, an oil producer and an elimination organ (it clears toxins from the body through evaporation and perspiration). Young skin is flexible, elastic, smooth and well hydrated.
									</h5>
									<h5 style="margin-left:2em;margin-right:2em;">
										It is important to protect the skin against damage to maintain its elasticity, appearance and overall health. Preventive methods include a healthy diet, supplements, daily moisturizing, sunscreens, not smoking, little drinking, and using hats, visors, sunglasses, etc. against UV light.
									</h5>
									<h5 style="margin-left:2em;margin-right:2em;">
										If damage or aging has occurred, anti-wrinkle, skin renewal, moisturizing and barrier-repair treatments are available to help stimulate the skin's natural production of collagen to help restore the structure of the skin and smooth out wrinkles.
									</h5>
									<h5 style="margin-left:2em;margin-right:2em;">
										Woodland Hills Pharmacy's aesthetic medicine formulas are created using premium pharmaceutical-grade active ingredients that have been carefully selected for their synergistic properties. Our formulations whether a topical cream or a chemical peel, are compounded under strict quality standards.

												<li>Hydroquinone-Free Bleaching Cream
												</li>
												<li>Over the past several years, hydroquinone has become a controversial skin-care ingredient for topical use. What is known for certain is that hydroquinone is a strong inhibitor of melanin production and for over 50 years has been established as the most effective ingredient for reducing and potentially eliminating brown skin discolorations on skin often referred to as melasma.
												</li>
												<li>Is Hydroquinone Safe?
												<br>
												Studies in rodents show "some evidence" that hydroquinone may act as a carcinogen or cancer-causing chemical, although its cancer-causing properties have yet to be proved in humans. There is also concern that hydroquinone is linked to increased risk of skin cancer, because it makes the skin more vulnerable to UV rays.
												<br>
												Ochronosis has been reported after topical use of hydroquinone. This is a condition where the skin becomes darker over time. It is fairly rare, and seems to be more common in darker skin tones. It also seems to occur after prolonged use of hydroquinone, i.e. several years. But there are no data available on how long hydroquinone can safely be used without increasing the risk of ochronosis.
												</li>
												<li>So what’s the bottom line here?
												<br>
												Hydroquinone cream has been used for decades, and is generally recognized as safe. There is some data to suggest hydroquinone could have negative side effects, but no clinical trials in humans have ever been done. In the face of little data, the practitioner will have to rely on their own judgment.

												<li>Retinoic Cream

												<li>Tretinoin acid (also called Retinoic Acid) is a derivative of vitamin A. It is used on the skin in the treatment of mild to moderate acne and on skin that has been damaged by excessive exposure to the sun. Retinoic acid irritates the skin and causes the cells of the skin to grow (divide) and die more rapidly, increasing the turnover of cells. The number of layers of cells in the skin actually is reduced.
												</li>
												<li>In patients with acne, new cells replace the cells of existing pimples, and the rapid turnover of cells prevents new pimples from forming. By a similar mechanism, Retinoic acid can reduce some wrinkles, areas of darkened skin (hyperpigmentation), and rough areas of skin, all of which occur in sun-damaged skin. In patients with sun-damaged skin, improvements in the skin usually are seen within the first 3 to 4 weeks of treatment. Brown spots begin to fade after 6 to 8 weeks. Wrinkles decrease or disappear after 3 to 6 months.

									<h5 style="margin-left:2em;margin-right:2em;">
										Mold is an extremely toxic substance caused, in some cases, by moisture in walls and floors where there is an absence of ventilation. Mold sickness is extremely serious and should be treated by a doctor. The early symptoms often look like other sicknesses, so it is important to know what to look for to treat it correctly. People who have a deficient immune system are more susceptible to mold sickness.
									</h5>
									<h5 style="margin-left:2em;margin-right:2em;">
										Beginning Stages

										Short-term and beginning stages of mold sickness can look like a basic cold or allergy attack because mold, in small doses, acts as an irritant. If you repeatedly receive any of the following symptoms after entering a building, that building may have a mold problem.

										watery, itchy eyes
										chronic cough
										headaches or migraines
										difficulty breathing
										rashes
										nasal blockage
										frequent sneezing
									</h5>
									<h5 style="margin-left:2em;margin-right:2em;">
										Advanced Stages

										If you are in an area that has been contaminated by mold for a long period of time, the following conditions may develop:

										constant headaches
										weight and hair loss
										diarrhea
										vomiting
										fatigue
										coughing up blood
										chronic bronchitis and sinus infections
										sexual dysfunction
										short-term memory loss
										skin rashes and sores
										Staying in a mold-infested environment for a long period of time can result in these symptoms, which are often the result of not seeing a doctor in time or choosing to remain in an area with mold without taking steps to clean it. If you get these symptoms, see a doctor immediately.

												<li>Brewer Protocol
												</li>
												<li>Dr Joseph Brewer, an infectious disease specialist from Kansas City Missouri, has developed a protocol to eliminate nasal colonized mycotoxins. Dr. Brewer and his associates, Jack Thrasher and Dennis Hooper, have published several papers on chronic illness associated with mold and mycotoxins. They concluded that the most likely reservoir for the colonization of mycotoxins was the sinus area. Once colonized mycotoxins are protected by a biofilm coating, preventing there elimination from by the body. Dr. Brewer reports that these mycotoxins impair mitochondrial function creating oxidative stress. Symptoms include: chronic fatigue, immune dysregulation and endocrine abnormalities.
												</li>
												<li>Two atomized solutions are the mainstay of treatment in the Brewer Protocol:

												Chelating PX 0.75% Solution

												Aerosolized intranasal EDTA/Polysorbate 80 is used to destroy biofilm which are harboring the mycotoxins.

												Amphotericin-B 0.25% Solution

												Once the biofilm is destroyed aerosolized intranasal Amphotericin-B is used to eliminate nasal colonized mycotoxins.
												</li>
												<li>NasoNeb Nasal Nebulizer

												The patented NasoNeb System features a unique combination of particle size, airflow and fluid volume.
												</li>
												<li>Rhino Clear Spring
												The Rhino Clear Sprint holds a full 15 mL of solution and atomizes 2 mL (1 treatment) in just 30 seconds. To prevent the risk of contaminating the solution, it also features a dedicated collection chamber to catch discharge. The Rhino Clear Atomizer is suitable for everyone ages 8 and up, and comes with three different sized nasal adaptors for a more custom fit.
												</li>
												<li>Synergy

												There is a synergy when the two therapies are done simultaneously. Chelating PX dissolves the biofilm coating, clearing the way for a direct attack and elimination of the mycotoxins by the topical Amphotericin-B. Dr. Brewer doses the Chelating PX in the morning and Amphotericin-B in the evening.
												</li>
												<li>
													Side Effects

												Ambphotericin-B can cause nasal irritation and even mild nosebleeds in a few cases. Treatment often causes a strong herx reaction (die-off) as the mycotoxins are exposed and the drug kills them. In both situations treatment should be cut back to appropriate levels if necessary.

It is a strong ion-exchange resin, which means that it can exchange its chloride ions with bile acids in the gastrointestinal tract and bind them strongly in the resin matrix. CSM has a ammonium side chain, which is of the right size and charge to bind with the toxic ionophores, preventing reabsorption. Traditionally used in lowering cholesterol, cholestyramine is also used in treating lyme disease and biotoxin illness.

												With myriad sinusitis medications available, what is the most effective treatment? Thousands of patients have found atomized sinus treatment to be one of the safest, most scientifically advanced and effective solution to beat sinusitis.
												</li>
												<li>The Atomized Sinus Treatment Method

												Also known as “aerosolized therapy,” atomized sinus treatment uses an atomizer to pump in liquid medication to the sinus area. This treatment tackles nasal allergies such as allergic rhinitis as well as all kinds acute and chronic sinus infections.
												</li>
												<li>What Kinds of Medications Are Used in This Treatment?

												Doctors generally prescribe liquid antibiotics, anti-fungals and anti-inflammatory medications
												</li>
												<li>How Does This Treatment Work?

												Once the atomizer and liquid medications are delivered to you, you are ready and equipped to atomize your way to sinus relief. With the guidance of your doctor and a sinus compounding pharmacy, this atomized sinus treatment is a simple do-it-yourself system. The compact electronic atomizer releases the liquid medication into mist that gets inhaled into the sinus and nasal cavity regions. The treatment lasts only three to five minutes.


												</li>
												<li>How Effective is This Kind of Treatment?

												Extremely. The key to its effectiveness lies in the small, minute mist particles passing into the small openings of the sinus area (only 1.0 to 3.2 micron-sized aerosol particles). When the mist particles are very fine, bacterial infections in the hard-to-reach sinus areas are killed and eliminated. No other sinus treatment is as successful
												</li>
												<li>The Rhino Clear Sprint is the latest drug delivery device offered by Woodland Hills Pharmacy. With its small, lightweight and portable design, being powered by 2 AA batteries (disposable or rechargeable), it affords patients the quickest treatment time. The Rhino Clear Sprint holds a full 15 mL of solution and atomizes 2 mL (1 treatment) in just 30 seconds. To prevent the risk of contaminating the solution, it also features a dedicated collection chamber to catch discharge. The Rhino Clear Atomizer is suitable for everyone ages 8 and up, and comes with three different sized nasal adaptors for a more custom fit.
												</li>
												<li>
												The Nasoneb Nebulizer differs from other nebulizers because this machine targets the nasal and paranasal sinus cavities. The nasoneb is the only large particle, low volume, high concentration delivery system available that has the support of clinical data. Patients who may benefit from the Nasoneb typically suffer from:

												Post sinus surgery with chronic nasal crusting and infection
												Recurrent nasal polyps
												Smell disorders
												Infections that sinus surgery cannot cure
												Recalcitrant allergic rhinitis
												Other rhinologic conditions
												</li>

												<li>Mupirocin 0.2% nasal spray contains the active ingredient mupirocin, which is an antibacterial medicine. It is used to eliminate staphylococcal bacteria from the nasal passages. In particular, it is usually reserved for eradicating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteria from the nasal passages.
												</li>
												<li>Certain bacteria, including MRSA, are found naturally on many people's skin and inside their nose. These bacteria are usually harmless and don't cause any problems. However they can cause infection if they get into a wound or spread to other parts of the body. It is important that these types of bacteria are eliminated, because they can not only cause infection in the carrier, but can also be spread to other people and potentially cause serious infections in people who are sick and vulnerable.
												</li>
												<li>The mupirocin works by affecting the bacteria's production of certain proteins that are neccessary for their survival. It causes the bacteria to produce abnormal and faulty proteins. This ultimately kills the bacteria.

												<li>Nasal Atomizers
												</li>
												<li>Get the Facts on Atomized Sinus Treatment

												There are almost 40 million Americans suffering from sinusitis every year. Some of the most common symptoms include colds, headache, coughing, congestion, facial pain and pressure, and postnasal drip. Sinusitis can happen again and again, becoming a vicious cycle for too many.

												With myriad sinusitis medications available, what is the most effective treatment? Thousands of patients have found atomized sinus treatment to be one of the safest, most scientifically advanced and effective solution to beat sinusitis.
												</li>
												<li>The Atomized Sinus Treatment Method

												Also known as “aerosolized therapy,” atomized sinus treatment uses an atomizer to pump in liquid medication to the sinus area. This treatment tackles nasal allergies such as allergic rhinitis as well as all kinds acute and chronic sinus infections.
												</li>
												<li>What Kinds of Medications Are Used in This Treatment?

												Doctors generally prescribe liquid antibiotics, anti-fungals and anti-inflammatory medications
												</li>
												<li>How Does This Treatment Work?

												Once the atomizer and liquid medications are delivered to you, you are ready and equipped to atomize your way to sinus relief. With the guidance of your doctor and a sinus compounding pharmacy, this atomized sinus treatment is a simple do-it-yourself system. The compact electronic atomizer releases the liquid medication into mist that gets inhaled into the sinus and nasal cavity regions. The treatment lasts only three to five minutes.


												</li>
												<li>How Effective is This Kind of Treatment?

												Extremely. The key to its effectiveness lies in the small, minute mist particles passing into the small openings of the sinus area (only 1.0 to 3.2 micron-sized aerosol particles). When the mist particles are very fine, bacterial infections in the hard-to-reach sinus areas are killed and eliminated. No other sinus treatment is as successful
												</li>
												<li>The Rhino Clear Sprint is the latest drug delivery device offered by Woodland Hills Pharmacy. With its small, lightweight and portable design, being powered by 2 AA batteries (disposable or rechargeable), it affords patients the quickest treatment time. The Rhino Clear Sprint holds a full 15 mL of solution and atomizes 2 mL (1 treatment) in just 30 seconds. To prevent the risk of contaminating the solution, it also features a dedicated collection chamber to catch discharge. The Rhino Clear Atomizer is suitable for everyone ages 8 and up, and comes with three different sized nasal adaptors for a more custom fit.
												</li>
												<li>
												The Nasoneb Nebulizer differs from other nebulizers because this machine targets the nasal and paranasal sinus cavities. The nasoneb is the only large particle, low volume, high concentration delivery system available that has the support of clinical data. Patients who may benefit from the Nasoneb typically suffer from:

												Post sinus surgery with chronic nasal crusting and infection
												Recurrent nasal polyps
												Smell disorders
												Infections that sinus surgery cannot cure
												Recalcitrant allergic rhinitis
												Other rhinologic conditions
												</li>

												<li>Budesonide 0.02mg/ml Enema
												</li>
												<li>Budesonide is a synthetic steroid that has an anti-inflammatory effect. It is used to reduce inflammation associated with inflammatory bowel diseases.
												</li>
												<li>Budesonide decreases inflammation by acting within cells to prevent the release of certain chemicals that are important in the immune system. These chemicals are normally involved in producing immune and allergic responses. By decreasing the release of these chemicals in a particular area, inflammation is reduced.
												</li>
												<li>Budesonide enema is administered into the rectum to reduce inflammation associated with ulcerative colitis affecting the lower end of the bowel and rectum. Budesonide acts locally to reduce inflammation in this area and helps relieve the symptoms of flare-ups of ulcerative colitis. One enema is administered into the rectum at night for four weeks. The full effect is usually seen within two to four weeks of treatment. If the inflammation in the bowel is not controlled after four weeks, it may be used for a further four weeks.

												<li>Sodium Butyrate 100 mM/liter Enema
												</li>
												<li>Butyrate is a fatty acid that is synthesized in the intestine when certain carbohydrates are fermented during the digestive process. Butyrate has been studied for use in treating inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and ulcerative colitis in particular.
												</li>
												<li>What Is Butyrate?

												Some carbohydrates pass through the intestines without being fully digested. Instead, they are fermented by the bacteria in the colon, and give off various byproducts. Butyrate is one such byproduct which then goes on to be used as a fuel by the cells in the lining of the colon.
												</li>
												<li>Why Butyrate May Be Beneficial in Treating Ulcerative Colitis:

												Butyrate has been shown to be beneficial to the cells in the intestinal tract by combating inflammation, preventing cells from becoming cancerous, reducing the effects of oxidative stress, and strengthening the colonic defenses.

												Butyrate enemas have been studied for use in treating ulcerative colitis. Some studies have shown that the topical use of butyrate may help decrease the inflammation in the colon that is caused by ulcerative colitis.

												Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO) is a condition where the small intestine is populated by an abnormal amount and/or types of bacteria.
												</li>
												<li>SIBO is a condition in which colonic-type bacteria (resembling bacteria normally found in the colon) proliferate in large numbers in the small intestine.
												SIBO may be caused by dysfunction of intestinal muscles or intestinal obstruction.
												The symptoms of SIBO are abdominal pain, bloating, gas, and diarrhea.
												SIBO can be treated with erythromycin 50mg capsules, probiotics, or a combination of both.
												Erythromycin 50mg capsules are usually given once daily at bedtime. Some patients may respond better to twice-a-day protocol.
												Treatment is continued for 3 to 4 months at which time the patient is reevaluated.

												<li>Immunomodulators
												</li>
												<li>As the name implies, immunomodulators weaken or modulate the activity of the immune system. That, in turn, decreases the inflammatory response. Immunomodulators are most often used in organ transplantation to prevent rejection of the new organ as well as in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Since the late 1960s, they have also been used to treat people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which appears to be caused by an overactive immune system. These drugs can be appropriate in the following treatment situations:
												</li>
												<li>Non-response to or intolerance of aminosalicylates, antibiotics, or corticosteroids
												Steroid-dependent disease or frequent need for steroids
												Perianal (around the anus) disease that does not respond to antibiotics
												Fistulas (abnormal channels between two loops of intestine, or between the intestine and another structure such as the skin)
												</li>
												<li>Because immunomodulators often take up to three to six months to see an improvement in symptoms, steroids are often started at the same time to produce a faster response. Lower doses of the steroid may be required in this case, producing fewer side effects. Corticosteroids also may be withdrawn more rapidly when combined with immunomodulators. For that reason, immunomodulators are sometimes referred to as “steroid-sparing” drugs.
												</li>
												<li>Two immunomodulators used to treat IBD are cyclosporine and tacrolimus. Both have been shown to be safe and effective in the treatment of severe ulcerative colitis.
